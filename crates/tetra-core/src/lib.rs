//! Core utilities for TETRA BlueStation
//!
//! This crate provides fundamental types and utilities used across the TETRA stack:
//! - BitBuffer for bit-level PDU manipulation
//! - TdmaTime for TDMA frame timing
//! - Address types (ISSI, GSSI, etc.)
//! - PHY types (PhyBlockNum, BurstType, etc.)
//! - Common macros and debug utilities
